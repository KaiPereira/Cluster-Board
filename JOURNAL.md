## Day 1 - Research Galore - 6 Hours

Recently, I came across a video from one of my favorite content creators, [Bitluni](https://www.youtube.com/@bitluni) about building a Risc-V supercluster. This was one of the coolest concepts I've ever seen in my life, combining the power of 100's of micro controllers to create a decently powerful system.

![Pasted image 20250815210804.png](journal/Pasted%20image%2020250815210804.png)

But then I thought to myself, what if we scaled this up, what if we went BIG.

I started doing some research on cluster boards and how they actually work. I noticed that Bitluni's board was very similar to my Cheetah MX4, 3DP motherboard, so knowing that I kind of had some previous knowledge to what I was looking into, really helped alot!

I figured out that Bitluni basically had this cluster board, and then on that cluster board, it had these connectors called PCIe which allowed fast data transfer but also to basically plug in cards to your board like a PC.

This was such a cool concept, creating a cluster of computers that acted as a swarm, from basically many mini computers, I had to make one too.

You already know how I function though, I needed to go a bit bigger than Bitluni so I started researching about cluster boards, specifically CM4 cluster boards. Basically, rasp pi makes these things called "pi compute modules" (CMx) which can basically plug into these types of motherboards using PCIe or other connectors to turn their plain PCB, into a devboard of sorts with extra features on the cluster board.

Jeff Geerling is a really interesting guy I came across who loves messing around with cluster boards like this, I'd highly suggest checking out his stuff and learning how it all works https://www.jeffgeerling.com/

Anyways, I kind of know exactly what I want to make now, a cluster board with custom compute modules for maximum power, it takes a bit of time to wrap your head around this concept of PCB's on PCB's but it's really cool. I also kind of want to go overkill, I never like making stuff that the ordinary person would make, so something that sounds impressive, like 100's of gb's of ram, or 100's of gpu's, just the wow factor.

I was on a plane basically doing all this research, so it gave me a solid 6 hours of time on research what exactly a cluster board is and how everything works, but I've only just scratched the surface.

## Day 2 - Linux, linux and linux - 8 Hours

Before I wanted to dive more into this project, I wanted to understand some of the software behind what I'm actually doing. I came across this insanely cool resource called https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/series/mastering-embedded-linux/ which teaches Linux embedded systems from a very high level standpoint.

The reason I wanted to look into this, is to understand what goes into making a compute module. You see, you need the RAM, storage, boot ROM, SoC and peripherals to make the board, like USB, UART, SPI, ADC, etc. All the basically combined to form a compute module.

![Pasted image 20250815210554.png](journal/Pasted%20image%2020250815210554.png)

On the software side, it looks something like the bootloader -> linux -> the ssh server, web server, interface, programs anything the user can interact with or run on. So you basically boot your device into linux, and then you can interact with the miniature filesystem that you have access to, it's like a mini computer.

![Pasted image 20250815210615.png](journal/Pasted%20image%2020250815210615.png)

Now you're probably wondering, what's an SoC... SoC stands for System on Chip, it's basically a complete system squeezed onto a tiny piece of silicon. On the SoC, you'll find:
- The CPU
- Sometimes accelerators like an NPU, GPU, DSP, etc.
- I/O controllers
- Peripherals
- Sometimes other things like bluetooth/wifi, security, an SoC can have *anything*

But anyways, let's go over some of the core parts...

The CPU is the brain of the SoC, I could talk for years about how the CPU works, but it basically executes the instructions of your programs.

The accelerators are specialized parts of the chips that are really good at specific things like training AI, or math, for example, a GPU is really good at math and AI, a DSP is really good at audio acceleration, there's so many different types of accelerators.

The I/O controllers handle like the different communication protocols like USB, ethernet, PCIe, etc. Just internal data flow in general, transferring information to and from inside the SoC.

The peripherals actually do something, produce sound, display stuff, control motors, etc. They're GPIO's, ADC's, DAC's, PWM controllers, everything that controls stuff.

And then sometimes chips have some other cool things like wifi/bluetooth, these are just other little "blocks" of hardware inside of the SoC that does stuff.

We've only talked about INSIDE of the SoC thought, what about outside of it?

Let's talk about the SoM, the System on Module.... This is basically those compute modules I was talking about, those are SoM's. When you add RAM to the outside of your SoC, that's part of the SoM, so what are all the things you need on the SoM.

The SoM will typically have RAM, the SoC, storage, power management, clocking, connectors, everything that you would find on a pi compute module persay. It turns the little SoC complete system, into a full computer ready to run programs, operating systems, anything your heart desires.

Now lots of people are probably wondering what RAM actually is.. It's basically like storage for the data and instructions that the SoC is actively using, so more RAM is more computational power!

The storage is long term memory (while RAM is short term), it'll hold the operating system, programs, data, everything. Sometimes there's a thing called the bootloader, which is a small program that runs when the SoM turns on, it's sometimes stored in the storage or sometimes in the SoC.

Power management is another things that's really important. The cluster board get's a primary voltage of like 12 - 48V, and you need to regulate it down for the SoC, RAM, peripherals, etc. All the different parts have different voltage requirements so you have to properly regulate the voltage and distribute it to the components on the compute module. You'll also usually want monitoring or power protection, just to make sure you don't actually ruin a component on the board.

And finally, there's all those extra parts on the board like the clock, connectors, etc. The clock is usually pretty important because it makes sure that everything is working in unison together. Think of it like an orchestra, it would be the conductor, it's very important to have a crystal for things like external connectors where data needs to leave the SoC at proper intervals, and generally just the SoC to make sure everything's working right. 

And then there's the connectors, depending on what you make, you'll need more or less, I'm making compute modules so I don't actually need like USB or ethernet ports or anything on the actual card, I just need PCIe lanes where all the information from the motherboard will travel to the cards, think of it like a really big connectors that everything will travel through. This makes it very modular, and very fast, because it goes directly to the motherboard. You can also put like debugging headers on the compute module to make sure that each card is working properly, I'll decide on this later.

Anyways, I spent a REALLY long time writing this, it helps me solidify the information of what I've learned so it's helpful for me too. This is just the start to how the board will work though, what I've described is just how the computational modules will work, we haven't even gotten to the motherboard yet. This should give a solid understanding to how the hardware to work, and I've given a brief overview of the software which is also quite interesting!

Once you start looking at many linux capable boards, you'll start to see the patterns:

![Pasted image 20250815210716.png](journal/Pasted%20image%2020250815210716.png)

I've also learned quite a bit more than what I've described, like a high level overview of the software and potential part choices, but I'll save that for when I have a better idea.

## Day 3 - Rise of the Turing Pi - 8 Hours

While doing all this research, I came across a board that Jeff Geerling had tried out. It was basically what I was trying to make, a 4-node ITX motherboard that supports up to 128gb of ram and each compute module supported up to 6 TOPS of NPU performance using their RK1 board, this was the turing pi 2 https://turingpi.com/product/turing-pi-2-5/ . This is going to be one of the core motivations for my project, to make something *better* than this board. 

![Pasted image 20250815211305.png](journal/Pasted%20image%2020250815211305.png)

The turing pi provides a really good core concept of what you need on a cluster board:
- Ethernet
- BMC controller
- GbE switch
- Mini PCIe express slots
- DSI and HDMI
- USB
- SATA and M.2 ports
- Breakout GPIO's
- Power of course
- SIM slot
- And then the 4 node modules

![Pasted image 20250815210117.png](journal/Pasted%20image%2020250815210117.png)

These are kind of the core things you need on a cluster motherboard, and actually a computer motherboard in general, with a few alterations, you could turn this cluster board into a desktop computer motherboard, but that's NO FUN!

On a cluster board, there's usually 2 ethernet ports, one to communicate internally, and one to communicate externally. The external ethernet usually acts as an uplink which you can wire to the internet or a router or something to communicate with it. The internet one acts as the cluster fabric that you could wire up to another motherboard (so 2 motherboards attached) to act as basically another cluster, isn't that so cool! So you could create clusters on clusters of these boards!!!

The BMC controller is basically the parent to the compute modules, it helps manage power, monitor, network, etc. It can basically control and monitor your entire cluster. It's usually a dedicated MCU that's always powered on and basically babysits the compute modules.

The GbE switch is incredibly important, it basically connects all the compute modules together so that they can act as one. It handles the switching between compute modules and aggregates all the traffic from every node.

The Mini PCIe express slots basically act as extra nodes for the board for adding extra capabilities that the normal compute modules don't have. For example, you could add dedicated accelerator cards, modems, storage, anything that supports mini PCIe and that you've implemented on your board. It's really cool!

The DSI/HDMI is fairly simple, it basically just lets you hook up a monitor to your SoM so that you can interface graphically with your board. They're not actually necessary, but they're really useful if you don't want to just communicate to your board via other connectors.

The extra USB's on the board are for really anything that is supported. Whether that's keyboards, mice, external storages, you pretty much know the geist, anything that you would plug into your own laptop that's supported. You really have to take into account the protocols your SoC/MCU supports just to make sure that you could add things like extra external storage. Typically, you usually have one USB per node and each node can kind of act as it's own device, very neat stuff! Sometimes you'll also have like a USB-C port on your board too which provides enough power to not run the entire motherboard, but to just program it.

Next up is the SATA and M.2 ports. You might've heard of these if you've ever built a computer before, they let you interface with things like HDD's, SSD's, wifi sometimes using a specific connector cable. They're easy ways of opening up more features to the user.

The breakout GPIO's are basically extra I/O headers that are on the board if you want to add whatever hardware your heart desires. Sensors, LED's, UART, PWM, whatever you want, you can think of them like the GPIO's on the Rasp Pi 5, they're just general I/O pins that allow flexibility and customization of your motherboard.

Then we have the power, it's pretty straightforward, it's just usually a single DC input that's distributed to all the modules, sometimes stepped down or buck converted.

Sometimes you'll find a SIM slot on a motherboard. It gives your board cellular network connectivity that's useful when you don't have wired internet. It's just like the SIM slot on your phone and will typically be connected to a mini PCIe modem card.

Boards will also usually have an SD Card slot that will act as additional storage so you could like run different operating systems if you want and to quickly change stuff up. You'll find that's it's often times on the bottom, this is because it takes up lots of space but isn't actually required for the board to function, so you can kind of just solder it on the board if you really want it, it's not necessary though.

And then of course you'll have the SoM's/nodes on your board. These are usually connected via backplane or mezzanine connectors like PCIe, and you can like stack them on the board to get more or less power/features. This is the core concept of our board.

You'll hear me use the words backplane and mezzanine, they are **structural** components on a board, basically giving it another dimension. This allows you to increase circuit density, it's insanely interesting and works very well!

![Pasted image 20250815210344.png](journal/Pasted%20image%2020250815210344.png)

Anyways, I now have a really strong overview of what I'm actually making from a high level standpoint and I hope that you've also learned something from all my talking! It takes me a really long time to gather all this information, but it's insanely cool once you understand it.

I'm now confident enough to start picking out some components for my board and getting more into the exact specifics of what I want to build.

## Day 4 - Parts and specifics :D - 10 Hours

Now that I've learned about pretty much everything that you actually have on a cluster board and compute module, it's time to think more about the specifics of the actual board I'm going to make.

I'm going to start off with designing the compute module because it's easy to just produce and then test out quickly which is very convenient, you kind of need the compute modules for the motherboard too, so I think it's the right thing to start with.

Anyways the first thing I have to do for designing my SoM (compute module) is choosing an SoC. Now I have a couple SoC's I've had my eye on while researching. Notably:
- RP2350 - Cheap, decently powerful, all around
- Rockchip RK3588 - Moderately expensive, insanely powerful, many good features
- Intel N100 - Moderately expensive, hard to integrate but powerful, windows support
- NXP i.MX 8M Plus - Moderately expensive, reliable and decently powerful
- NVIDIA Jetson Orin - EXPENSIVE, insanely powerful GPU capabilities meant more for cluster
- WCH CH32V003 - Dirt cheap, risc-v, good for a silly 256 core+ project

Honestly the RP2350 probably shoudn't even be on this list, but it was the first thing I thought of for this project. I also thought that a cheap CH32V003 chip would be fun like the one Bitluni did to maybe get like over 100, maybe even 1000, but it's not really the type of project I want to make.

Overall I kind of want to go with the Rockchip RK3588, it's insanely powerful, a bit pricy, but perfect in my opinion for this board. It's the same chip the Turing RK1 used,  and I think it's a very good option.

I also want to support maybe some other types of cards for this board like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin, but not design the SoM, just buy one.

Now let's take a quick look at the RK3588, it doesn't have many docs, but it's really cool:
- Octo-core CPU, insane for multithreading and pure power
- Low power control which is very helpful for a motherboard if you want sleep states persay
- ARM Mali-G610 MC4 GPU with 4 shader cores, which will give some good acceleration for mathematics and stuff
- 6 TOPS of performance on the NPU, which will honestly be a standout feature, because you'll be able to run large AI training on the cluster which is really cool.
- 64 Bit LPDDR4/LPDDR5 memory which is insanely cool, because you could design for insanely powerful DDR5 ram, but I'll probably just stick with DDR4.
- eMMC which is basically soldered down storage and is up to 10x faster than SD cards. It's also more compact and works alongside SSD's and drives
- Up to 8K at 60Hz and dual display which is really good for multi media, so I'll definitely add HDMI
- 48 mega pixels ISP per camera input which gives it really powerful computer features
- Some good audio interfaces, I won't really go into it
- High speed dual USB 3.1 and other interface connection support
- Some good security features

I wrote all of this by hand which took a long time... But you can tell that this SoC is a beast for around just $50, so while the compute modules will probably be over $100 each, it'll be insanely powerful.

Now that I've chosen my SoC, I want to look into all the parts on the SoM again and just choose what I want to focus on. So on the SoM I need:
- RAM - LPDDR4/5
- eMMC
- Power management - I think there's actually like a specific IC for this
- Debugging - Maybe some headers to interact with the compute module without PCIe
- PCIe interface - The main connector to the motherboard backplane
- Networking - GbE phy, I'll explain this soon

Now the first thing I learned while making this list was the GbE Phy which is basically the physical ethernet layer and can transfer data at 1 GB/s, it's needed for ethernet. 

The second thing I learned was that there's a dedicated power management module called the PMIC (power management IC). It's basically many buck converters and LDO's on one chips and handles the power rails, sequencing and voltage for the board.

The first thing I kind of want to focus on for the SoM is the RAM. Now I could support LPDDR5, but it's really just overkill and not needed, so I'll just go with the LPDDR4 because it's cheaper.

Now it's actually a bit hard to find LPDDR4 RAM, JCLCPB is almost all out of LPDDR4 specifically, but I kind of want to source it from their parts library so I can get PCBA and not have to reflow BGA or anything like that...

I did find 32 Gb's of LPDDR4 on JLCPCB for $110 in the form of 16, 2Gb chips, but that's a tad expensive and I feel like I could get it lower. But the advantages of this, is I could just get PCBA, but 16 ram chips is absolutely absurd.

Anyways I asked on the KiCad discord server for some help after this finding RAM and how complicated of a project this would be and figured out that I was in for a bit of a treat. I was informed that with all the absolute insane amount of connections I had, and the BGA parts, I'd need 10 layer HDI, which would cost around $1000 for just the boards, and I'd also need insanely good impedance control. And this isn't even counting the fact that you still need to get the schematic perfectly right, and get all the PCB's assembled, so you're looking at almost $2000, just for a chance that it works.

So for now, I'm going to focus my attention on building the cluster board, because I think I'll actually learn more building that and it's also not as complicated or as expensive, but still pretty darn hard.

## Day 5 - Let's build a cluster board

Now that I've postponed my compute module shenanigans, I want to focus my attention on building the cluster board.

Now I've already gone over what you actually need for a cluster board, so let's go over the specs of MY cluster board I want to build.

Now building a board exactly like the Turing Pi 2 is actually insanely hard, this is because the Turing Pi 2 has LOTS of high speed traces because it uses PCIe for stuff like NVMe storage but I can just skip this stuff and just use like SD cards or something else.

I kind of want to model this board similar to the DeskPi Super6C but I want to include a BMC and maybe like an ethernet switch and potentially like PCIe for network cards or something, but I have to look into it a bit more.

![Pasted image 20250830224212.png](journal/Pasted%20image%2020250830224212.png)

**So here's what the board is going to look like:**

There's going to be 4 - 8 **vertical** mezzanine connectors (like the turing pi 2) with daughter cards, this makes everything a bit more expensive, but modular and it's a good intro before tackling this project. Also that means if the mainboard works but not the daughter cards, it's less expensive than just re-doing the entire board. This also means I can get 2 separate grants for my project so it'll cost me less to make!

A small BMC to control power, a small USB mux to communicate to individual modules and communication over ethernet. And maybe I'll use an esp-32 or something so it can have a web UI!

12/24V PSU through a barrel jack or an ATX connector, not quite sure which one yet, so it's easy to power with enough juice.

An ethernet switch with 4 - 8 downlinks and then 2 uplinks for the networking. This allows me to control lots of modules and actually stack the modules to make a super-cluster.

Fan headers so you can power fans to each module for cooling and maybe an RTC battery to help maintain the clock on the mainboard.

Per NVMe SSD storage, this isn't too much more complicated to add but I think it's pretty useful and important to have.

USB, HDMI and micro-USB. The micro-USB is for flashing, the USB is for peripherals and the HDMI is for video output!

And just like that, we pretty much have our entire board layed out. Tomorrow I want to research a bit more how the daughter card will work, and actually get started working on it.

## Day 6 - The daughter board - 5 Hours

Now the first thing we have to do before making the board, is creating daughter boards for all the compute modules. I'm focused on just making daughter cards for the CM4 and the CM5 so that's going to be my main focus.

![Pasted image 20250830224046.png](journal/Pasted%20image%2020250830224046.png)

Now the CM5 is pretty much a drop-in replacement for the CM4 so I don't need to design in anything extra other than just taking into account the extra power that the CM5 needs.

So now let's talk about what the daughter card actually needs on it.

So the first thing you need is the mezzanine connectors to attach the compute module to the daughter card, and the daughter card to the motherboard. It's also important that you have mechanical supports for the card so you don't damage it during insertion or replacement.

Next you need the power management, you need 3.3V and 5V, the 3.3V is for the NVMe SSD and the 5V is for the compute module.

Then you need your storage. This is eMMC, SD card or even both if you want. Personally I'm probably going to support both because it just adds rigidity to the board in case anything fails!

And then you just really need to break out what pins you want. This is like breaking out USB, UARD, Gigabit Ethernet and the NVMe storage and other stuff you want! The NVMe storage is a bit trickier than the others because if you break it out through the backplane connector, you need to manage the tricky high speed signals, or you can just break it out as a connector on the actual daughter card. If you break it out through the backplane, you can actually pool the storage which is cool, but it's way more complicated, so I'm just going to stick with a connector on the actual carrier.

And then you need the extra things on your board too like:
- the fan header, this is just a connector on the board for each fan to connect to the daughter card
- LED's and stuff for power and debugging, just kind of nice to have
- UART and JTAG headers for debugging
- Expose GPIO headers, I'll decide if I want to do this later but it's good if you want to add extra hardware to the daughter card which can be handy

And just like that, we've pretty much figured out the carrier board for the compute module! Now we can actually get started with making it!

So now let's start a new KiCad project and get started!

Now the first thing I want to figure out is the connector because it's like the core part of the boards purpose.  Now there's MANY different options for board connectors, but personally I want something really rigid because I like to make my projects high quality. It also needs a LOT pins so pretty dense, so I have a couple of options I've compiled:
- **Board-to-board mezzanine connectors**: very compact, but lack a bit of rigidity, but they're also not crazy expensive and there's lots of variety in the connectors
- **SO-DIMM edge card connector**: pretty compact but larger, pretty darn rigid, more expensive, and sometimes messes with RF tests and stuff apparently?

Now personally I think I'm going to go with the SO-DIMM edge card connector because I have the space of an ITX motherboard which is pretty huge and it's also got really nice rigidity and looks very high quality. Another advantage of the SO-DIMM is that's it's compatible with the Turing RK1 which I kind of want to get my hands on and make compatible with this board.

![Pasted image 20250831115510.png](journal/Pasted%20image%2020250831115510.png)

Now before I actually add this to the schematic, I'm going to clone this CM4 carrier template which just provides the exact dimensions for a carrier board so I don't accidentally mess up the very fine measurements https://github.com/ShawnHymel/rpi-cm4-carrier-template. I found this from this very helpful resource page from [Maker Forge](https://www.makerforge.tech/posts/cm5-carrier-basics/), which gives really good tips for making a carrier board and they also have a journal of them [making an actual carrier board](https://www.makerforge.tech/cm5-carrier-board/) too.

And just like that, we have a nice template for our carrier board and there's also a schematic for the mezzanine connectors pre-made so it's easy to add stuff to it!

![Pasted image 20250831225318.png](journal/Pasted%20image%2020250831225318.png)

And for now I'm just going to end it there because we've actually started working on the project and got a lot of the specs for the carrier board down!

## Day 7 - Starting the PCB - 8 Hours

Now that I have the compute module template down, I can actually get started working on it! 

The first thing I'm going to do, is figure out what connector I'm going to use for the backplane. And before I mentioned I was going with SODIMM, but after some more research, it might not be the best fit.

I need a connector that can handle mid-high speed traces, around 60 - 70 pins and be decently, but not too compact. So the options I've compiled are:
- SO-DIMM: Very rigid and compact, can handle high speeds, 200+ pins, expensive
- MICRO-DIMM: Rigid and very compact, can handle high speeds, 50+ pins, hard to source and expensive
- 0.8mm 60+ pin vertical mezzanine connector: Compact, can handle mid speeds, 60+ pins, easy to source and relatively cheap

And it's honestly an insanely tough choice between SO-DIMM and the vertical mezzanine connector, because while the mezzanine connector is way cheaper, it's not as rigid and sleek as the SO-DIMM. Also another advantage of the SO-DIMM, is that it's compatible with the Turing RK1 and lots of other daughter boards, so I honestly think I'm going to go with SO-DIMM.

Now the Turing RK1 uses a 260 pin SO-DIMM connector, so that's the same thing I'm going to use for my board. 

Now I'm actually going to create custom symbols because I'm having trouble finding some online and they're relatively simple. I'm going to create 6 (a, b, c, d, e, f) symbols, each with 40 pins to make it manageable. I'm just going to take the 200 pin connector and add on some more to make it easy! And just like we're done!

![Pasted image 20250901173123.png](journal/Pasted%20image%2020250901173123.png)

Now the Turing RK1 doesn't actually have a listed pinout, but it's the same one as the [Jetson Orgin carrier board](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/embedded/secure/jetson/orin_nano/docs/Jetson-Orin-Nano-DevKit-Carrier-Board-Specification_SP-11324-001_v1.3.pdf?__token__=exp=1756774659~hmac=b387e6facfb238adbd28ccc2a997d7d18f1f6ecd9e7dd8d21f77d45d6cec9db7&t=eyJscyI6ImdzZW8iLCJsc2QiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb29nbGUuY29tLyJ9) so I have to use that as reference! And I already know I'm in for a really complicated project....

So here's all the features I need:
- USB-C/USB 3.2
- Gigabit Ethernet
- Display Port
- M.2 Key E connector
- Expansion header
- UI and indicators
- Fan connector
- Power

I decided to include the M.2 Key E connector, because I figured out that it's only the M connector that's complicated to route and the E connector still gives me features like a network card and stuff I can add on.

This list was pretty much taken from the Jetson Orin carrier board datasheet, because it's the features I need to expose so that's it's supported!

So let's get started with putting the first thing down, the first thing I learned is that SODIMM is actually 2 sided, so 130 pins on one side, 130 on the other, so I redid my symbol to be a bit more accurate!

![Pasted image 20250901182004.png](journal/Pasted%20image%2020250901182004.png)

And then I actually realized that the A and the B have to be at the start of the number (to look good....) so I re-did it again because I'm a perfectionist. And then after that I labelled all the GND's on my schematic based off of the jetson orin carrier board pinout.

And turns out, I was looking at the wrong datasheet, the one I was looking at was for the carrier board of the nano, and not the nano itself (which already has SODIMM so it doesn't need a carrier for SODIMM). [So this is the right datasheet](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/embedded/secure/jetson/orin_nx/docs/Jetson_Orin_NX_Orin_Nano_Pin_Function_Names_Guide_DA-11434-001_v1.0.pdf?__token__=exp=1756784920~hmac=4e1bb813f3562bd7b8484fd6d26ed09d41b7602d230afc62c7dfb80b68671c15&t=eyJscyI6ImdzZW8iLCJsc2QiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb29nbGUuY29tLyJ9).

So NOW, I actually have the right ground pins for my SODIMM:

And next, I'm going to add the power to my board. Now the CM5 takes a 5V input, so I'm going to handle the power management on the cluster board, and then just route it through the SODIMM into the mezzanine connector directly. But I do need some decoupling on the daughter card, but there's no datasheets to help me, because it's kind of the edge case of making a carrier board (you're not following like an IC datasheet, but making your own module), so I kind of have to figure out decoupling myself.

I decided to put one 0.1uF cap for every VDD pin (9), and then do a 10uF cap for each GROUP of VDD pins (2), and this gives me good high frequency and bulk decoupling for the power lines which I think is a good balance.

And I'm following the NVIDIA Jetson pinout for the SODIMM, so all the VDD pins are just near the end of the connector, and I think that pin 260 is just unused, and for mechanical usage, but I'm not 100% sure.

Now for most of the rest of these pins, I'm going to have to look at the [CM5 datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cm5/cm5-datasheet.pdf) and wire to be pin compatible with the NVIDIA Jetson pinout which requires careful attention.

The first big thing I want to get out of the way, is wiring all the USB pins. It took me quite a long time, but you basically just have to wire the USB lines from the CM5, to the SODIMM while making sure you don't mess up the pinout of the NVIDIA Jetson so it requires careful attention.

The 2 standout things while wiring it was the USB_VBUS, which let's the BMC control the power on the USB ports so that's going to need a load switch on the cluster board, and then the NVIDIA Jetson has 3 USB 3.x ports while the CM5 only has 2, so I didn't wire the third. And just like that, it looks amazing!

Next up, I decided to wire up the ethernet onto my board. Ethernet has 4 differential pairs which all need to be wired to the SODIMM from the CM5 mezzanine connector, but it also has status LED's which need to be wired too. 

Now you can wire these status LED's onto the actual daughter card, or you can break them out onto the SODIMM. I decided to break out the 2 status LED's for activity and speed to the SODIMM, and then put the Pi activity LED onto the daughter card to show it's on.

It wasn't too complicated to figure out, but getting this concept though my head was a bit challenging. I decided to just breakout the LED's because that's what the NVIDIA Jetson does, and I kind of want to stay as pin compatible and concise as possible.

And just like that, we have ethernet wired up!

And then after this, I realized that some of my net labels were facing the wrong way (for input/output/bidirectional) and also, I was MISSING some USB lines too!!!! So I fixed those pretty quickly and it looks much better now!

Next, I want to implement the fans, I'm really just going in a kind of random order, but I want to tackle on the easier pins first. The fans just need PWM and Tacho (Not Taco!!!). Tacho is basically an output pin that the CM5 implements for fans that let you read it's current RPM, it's pretty cool and PWM just lets you control the fans.

It was a bit weird, because the pins on the CM5 symbol said they belong to ethernet, but they're actually multiplexed as both ethernet pins AND PWM/Tacho, and I didn't need the 2 ethernet pins I used, so I just made them fan pins.

And just like that, we're done implementing the fan pins!!!

Anyways I spent a pretty long time working on this, so I'm going to end it off here. This is some insanely good tangible progress though which always helps inspire me during my projects!

Tomorrow I'm going to try and get all the pins wired to the SODIMM, and then maybe start working on the eMMC or the NVMe wiring.

## Day 8 - SODIMM so cool!

I made a lot of really good progress yesterday, so let's continue it!

The first thing I want to do is implement HDMI. HDMI isn't too complicated to wire, but routing is a different story... HDMI is pretty straightforward though, it's got 3 differential pairs of TX wires to drive to signals, and one differential pair of clock wires to keep everything synchronized.

And then, there's the I2C bus, SCL and SDA which are bidirectional and can transmit information like the display size and whatnot to the CM5. And to add on, there's also the HPD (hot plug detect) which just lets the source know if a device is plugged in, and there's the CEC (consumer electronics control), which just let's consumer signals be sent to the source like power on/off, audio, etc.

So it wasn't too complicated to wire, and just like that, we have HDMI implemented!

I also fixed a bunch of the net labels going the wrong way which I messed up for some reason, so you'll notice some changes there!

Anyways next, I wanted to implement SD cards onto the board, now there's 2 options of how I could do this:
- Put the SD cards on the cluster board and route them through the SODIMM connector
- Put the SD cards onto the daughter board and have them nicely self-contained

Now putting on the cluster board would add more routing and complexity, and the jetson also doesn't expose an SD card so it gets a bit confusing, so I think I'm going to include the SD card on the actual daughter card.

Now the only real problem with adding the SD card to the daughter card is space, but I honestly think it's going to be fine, and while it does make the daughter card slightly more expensive, I think it's worth it. So let's implement the SD card!

Now SD cards are pretty simple, I basically just route the signals from the mezzanine connector to the SD card directly, and just add decoupling to the power lines. Now the one thing you kind of want for something like this is a power switch so you can turn off the SD card if you're using eMMC or NVMe instead, so I need to add this little power switch circuit to the board.

I just took all of this from the CM5 datasheet, but I think it looks pretty good!
